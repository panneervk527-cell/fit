## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+** installed on your system.
- A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can obtain one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository).

### Installation & Setup

**1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd "AI-Powered Personalized Workout & Diet Planner"
```

**2. Create a virtual environment**
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

**3. Activate the virtual environment**
- **Windows:**
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- **Linux/Mac:**
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

**4. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**5. Configure Environment Variables**
Copy the `.env.example` file to create a new `.env` file in the root directory.
```bash
cp .env.example .env  # On Linux/Mac
copy .env.example .env # On Windows
```
Open `.env` and add your Gemini API Key:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

**6. Initialize Database and Run the Application**
The database (`fitness_app.db`) will be automatically initialized via SQLAlchemy upon the first run.
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application should now be running locally at `http://localhost:8501`.
